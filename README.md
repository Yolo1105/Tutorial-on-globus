# Globus Tutorial

## Introduction

Globus is a cloud-based service designed for secure, reliable file transfer, sharing, and data management across various institutions. It's especially useful for handling large datasets and features tools like Globus Flows and Globus Compute for automating workflows and facilitating data analysis.

## Setting Up Globus

### Create a Globus Account

1. Visit the [Globus website](https://www.globus.org/) and sign up using your institutional or a personal email address. If you're affiliated with NYU, you can use your NYU credentials for seamless integration.

### Install Globus Connect Personal

To transfer files from a personal computer, you need to install Globus Connect Personal. Follow these steps:

1. Download the installer from the [Globus Connect Personal page](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal).
2. Follow the installation prompts on your machine.
3. During setup, give your endpoint a unique name for easy identification.

For Linux users, you might need to install GTK+ on your system. Here are the commands for common distributions:

- **Ubuntu/Debian-based Systems**:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0
    ```

If you encounter issues with the GUI or prefer a command-line setup, you can run Globus Connect Personal with the `--no-gui` option:

```sh
./globusconnectpersonal -setup --no-gui
```

### Use Globus Connect Server for Institutional Servers

For institutional servers or shared resources, the setup is typically handled by the institution's IT department.

## Basic File Transfer with Globus

### Log In

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the [Globus Web App](https://app.globus.org/).
2. Log in using your Globus account. Institutional credentials (e.g., NYU) may be used if applicable.

### Choose Your Source Endpoint

1. Click on the "File Manager" tab.
2. Type the name of your endpoint (e.g., your personal computer) in one of the search bars. Select it from the dropdown.

### Navigate to the Files You Wish to Transfer

1. Browse the directory structure to locate the files or folders you want to transfer.

### Choose Your Destination Endpoint

1. In the other panel, search for and select the destination endpoint using the search bar.

### Initiate the Transfer

1. Select the files or folders you wish to transfer.
2. Click the "Start" or "Transfer" button. Monitor the progress in the "Activity" tab.

## Sharing Data with NYU and Outside Entities

### Share Data

1. Navigate to the endpoint containing the data you wish to share.
2. Select the 'Share' option and create a shared endpoint or use an existing one.
3. Set permissions, specifying whether users can view, download, or upload files.
4. Invite users via their email addresses. Ensure they have a Globus account if outside NYU.

## Globus Flows for Automated Data Management

### Create a Flow

1. Access the Globus Flows service through the [Globus web interface](https://app.globus.org/flows).
2. Use the visual or JSON editor to define your flow, including triggers, actions, and conditions.
3. Activate the flow, providing the necessary input parameters. It will run automatically based on the triggers and conditions you've set.

## Globus Compute for Data Analysis

### Setting Up a Compute Task

1. Define your computing task, specifying the application, input data, and computing resources.
2. Use Globus to transfer input data to the computing resource.
3. Monitor the task through the Globus interface or the computing resource's native tools.
4. Upon completion, transfer the output data back to your desired location using Globus.

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to getting started with Globus for file transfers, data sharing, and leveraging advanced features for data management and analysis.
